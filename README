The new erofs-utils introduces a completely new framework,
which is more cleaner but still under development for now.

Use the old the mkfs-dev branch of erofs-utils temporarily
to build erofs image instead:
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xiang/erofs-utils.git -b mkfs-dev

Thanks,
